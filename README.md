# G6-Milestone

In this project, we will be creating an expense tracker. 
We will be utilizing skills learned in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express and MongoDB.

3rd party applications that will be used are:
- Tailwind.css (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)
    - Code was used from Tailwind.css and utilized as templates for some of the CSS design for the project.
- Chart.js (https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/doughnut.html#doughnut)
    - This site was used to have a template of the chart that we are using as the main chart for the project.
