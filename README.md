# G6-Milestone

## In this project, we will be creating an expense tracker. 

### We will be utilizing skills learned in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express and MongoDB.

#### 3rd party applications that will be used are:

- Tailwind.css (*https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app*)
    - Code was used from Tailwind.css and utilized as templates for some of the CSS design for the project.
- Chart.js (*https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/doughnut.html#doughnut*)
    - This site was used to have a template of the chart that we are using as the main chart for the project.
 - Boxicon.js (*https://boxicons.com*)
    - Boxicon is used for the trash logo for the delete history function button.

Additional insight was taken from forums and websites such as *stackoverflow.com* and *w3schools.com*.
